JAVASCRIPT:

document.getElementById()  VS document.querySelector():

Both the querySelector and getElementById methods let you retrieve an element from the JavaScript Document Object Model (DOM). However, each method has its own use cases.

In this guide, we break down the most common use case of both querySelector and getElementById. We also compare these two methods and walk you through a basic example of 
how each of them work.

What is querySelector?
The JavaScript querySelector() method lets you retrieve an element from the DOM, or the web page, using a CSS selector. This method comes with a sister function called 
querySelectorAll() which selects all the elements that match a particular selector from the DOM.

These two methods are incredibly versatile. This is because CSS selector syntax lets you select any element from a web page.

Using querySelector, you don’t have to worry about being constrained by only being allowed to select elements by class or IDs, like you would if you used getElementById 
or getElementsByClassName.

These methods are particularly useful if the elements you are selecting are similar to those you select in your CSS stylesheet.

Let’s take a look at the querySelector method. We’ll start by writing an HTML element that we can later select in JavaScript:

1
<p class="accessibility">Skip to main content</p>
We have defined a paragraph of text with the class name “accessibility”. Next, let’s select this paragraph using the querySelector() method.

1
const accessibility_elements = document.querySelector(".accessibility");
This code lets us select the first element whose class is equal to “accessibility”. The “.” denotes that we want to select a class. If we had two elements with the class
“accessibility”, we could use the querySelectorAll() method to retrieve them both.

What is getElementById?
The getElementById() method retrieves an element based on its ID attribute, hence the name.

This method is more restrictive than querySelector because you can only retrieve elements based on their particular ID.

You would use this method if you only want to retrieve one element from the web page. This is because HTML IDs must be unique to a particular element. You cannot use an ID 
to refer to two elements on the web page.

Let’s retrieve an element using the getElementById selector. First, let’s write the HTML code from which we are going to select an element:

1
<section id="comments">
2
    <h2>Comments</h2>
3
</section>
Next, let’s write the JavaScript code to select an element from the DOM:

1
const comments_section = document.getElementById("comments");
We use the JavaScript statement to retrieve the element whose ID is equal to “comments”. This is the <section> element where we display comments on our web page.

querySelector vs. getElementById
The obvious similarity between these two methods is that they both select elements from a web page. They do so in different ways.

With a querySelector statement, you can select an element based on a CSS selector. This means you can select elements by ID, class, or any other type of selector. Using the 
getElementById method, you can only select an element by its ID.

Generally, you should opt for the selector that most clearly gets the job done.

If you only need to select an element by ID or class, you can use getElementById or getElementsByClassName, respectively. If you need to use a more elaborate rule to select 
elements, the querySelector method is your best option.

Both querySelector and getElementById have been part of JavaScript for a while. As a result, these methods are both fully supported on modern browsers.

Conclusion
The querySelector method lets you retrieve an element using a CSS selector query. The getElementById method retrieves an element by its DOM ID.

Both methods have wide browser support. You should opt to use the querySelector method if you need to select elements using more complex rules that are easily represented 
using a CSS selector. If you want to select an element by its ID, using getElementById is a good choice.

Now you have the knowledge you need to know when to use the querySelector and getElementById methods like a pro!

STEP 1:

document.body.style.backgroundColor = colors[randomNumber];

Here we select the body, the style and backgroundColor to make it equal to an element from the colors array.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

STEP 2:

color.textContent = colors[randomNumber];

Here we change the text inside of the container.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

STEP 3:

We need to create a function to generate a random number:

function getRandomNumber() {
	return Math.floor(Math.random()*colors.length); /*Because random only generates
	 numbers between 0 and 1.*/
	 /*We need Math.floor in order to round the generated numbers to integers*/
}

And we need to call this function:

const btn = document.getElementById("btn");
const color = document.querySelector(".color");
btn.addEventListener("click", function () {
	// get a random number between 0 and 3
	const randomNumber = getRandomNumber(); --------------------------------> Here is where we call the function.
	document.body.style.backgroundColor = colors[randomNumber];
	color.textContent = colors[randomNumber];
});

IMPORTANT:

* Math.random() --> Only  generates numbers between 0 an 1.

* We need to multiply by the length of the array to generate numbers between 0 and the lenght of the array.

* Math.random()*colors.length

* Finally it's necessary to use the method Math.floor to round the number to an integer number.

LAST STEP:

const hex = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"]; //This array is going to be used to generate random hex colors
// #f15025 Format of hex colors -----------------------------> One # symbol and six randomly generated characters (numbers of letters).
const btn = document.getElementById("btn");
const color = document.querySelector(".color");

btn.addEventListener('click', function(){
let hexColor = '#';
for(let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
	hexColor += hex[getRandomNumber()] -----> This adds # and the six generated characters.
}
color.textContent = hexColor;
document.body.style.backgroundColor = hexColor;
})

function getRandomNumber() {
	return Math.floor(Math.random()*hex.length);
}
